📝 Problem Solving Statement (Salesforce-based)

Traditional waste management systems face challenges such as overflowing bins, irregular waste collection, poor communication between citizens and municipal authorities, and lack of data-driven decision-making. These issues create unhygienic conditions, resource wastage, and low citizen engagement.

To solve this, we propose a Smart Waste Management Website built on the Salesforce Platform using its CRM capabilities, automation tools, and dashboards to ensure efficient, transparent, and smart waste management.
